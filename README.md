# 2024-12-Criptography

This repo collects two project in Criptography, implementing two different ciphers in ```Mathematica```.
- *"Zorro Chipher"* implements Zorro, a lightweight block cipher, and compares its performance with AES
- *"Simeck Cipher"* implements Simeck, a lightweight block cipher merging the design principles from the SIMON family of block ciphers and the Trivium stream cipher
